# rapid-router-ios
The iOS wrapper for the [Rapid Router Unity](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router-unity) game.

## Contributor Development Guide ##
There are a series of steps currently required to get up and running with the iOS version of the Rapid Router game. This is due to the fact that whilst the back end and models are written using Unity, this is wrapped and imported into an XCode project in order to integrate with Google's Blockly framework.

For instructions on how to do this, please see the [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router-ios/blob/master/ContributorDevelopmentGuide.md)
